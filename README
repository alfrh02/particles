# 2D Particle System

### Todo

~~- [ ] More Particle parameters to be passed into Emitter - including being inputted as ranges~~
    ~~- [ ] Color~~
    ~~- [ ] Size~~
    ~~- [ ] Velocity~~
- [ ] Particle types
    - [ ] Smoke
    - [ ] Fire
    - [ ] Smoke & Fire
    - [ ] Rain
    - [ ] Galaxy
    - [ ] Boids
- [ ] Particle behaviour that uses Emitter parameters, i.e. gravity (orbiting around the Emitter);
- [ ] 2D objects for particles to interact with
    - [ ] Objects that are:
        - [ ] Placeable
        - [ ] Rotatable
    - [ ] Collision detection
- [ ] Additional Emitter behaviour
    - [ ] GUI Elements
    - [ ] Spawn area
        - [ ] Emitter turns into a rectangle, where user can specify width/height, Particle objects will spawn randomly within that rectangle
